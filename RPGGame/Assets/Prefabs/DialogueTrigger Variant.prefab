      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[3]
      value: Fire is the element of energy and devotion, of passion and strength.
        Fire people are strong-willed, opinionative, confident and powerful. They're
        driven, and strive to achieve goals. They can be stubborn.

        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[4]
      value: Water is the element of intellect, of calmness, of beauty. Water people
        are often laid-back, and 'go with the flow'. They're often good-looking,
        intelligent, and perceptive. Many have strong magical power, making ideal
        Mages or Wizards.

    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[5]
      value: Air is the element of adventure, of wandering, of drifting, of dreaming.
        Air people are dreamers, but they're floaty and rarely focused on one thing
        for long. Many travellers and wanderers and Adventurers are of the Air element,
        'living on the edge of the wind'.

        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[6]
      value: Earth is the element of wisdom, common sense, and hardiness. Earth people
        are usually tough and practical, and most certainly 'down to Earth'. They
        are wise and understanding, trustworthy, honest, and reliable. They can be
        extremely devoted to a cause or way of life, and are also good at solving
        puzzles.

    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[7]
      value: Light is the elemental epitome of goodness and justice. People with
        this element will live to Do Good, helping people wherever they can. They
        live for others moreso than for themselves. They are the most helpful, kind,
        and caring of elements, and often become Heroes.

    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[8]
      value: Dark is the elemental epitome of evil. Dark people are inherently self-centered
        and manipulative, often violent. They only do things to benefit themselves,
        and care little for other people. They are the polar opposites of Light people.

    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[9]
      value: Ether is still a mystery, as it occurs so rarely as to be considered
        almost mythical. Not much is written about it, and what is written is not
        highly reliable.
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[10]
      value: There are rumours of an eighth element, but that is all they are; rumours.
        Myths. There's no known evidence to support such claims.
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[11]
      value: The personality traits mentioned for each element in this book are the
        most common for those elements, but are by no means the only personalities
        such people can have. Good-aligned Dark-elemental people are not unheard
        of (take the Adventurer Bernard Stormkiller, for example).
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[0]
      value: Everything and everyone in the world has an innate affinity to at least
        one of several magical elements. People and spells are all monoelemental,
        and their Element determines their power, potential, and, in the case of
        people, their personalities.
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[1]
      value: There are seven known elements, divided into three distinct groups.
        There are the Natural Elements, which Nature is composed largely of; there
        are the Moral Elements, which are born from the essence of free will and
        the spirit of life and choice; there is also the odd Spiritual element group,
        which eludes many thaumatologists to this day.
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[2]
      value: There are four Natural elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - two
        Moral elements - Dark and Light - and only one known Spiritual element -
        Ether - though Ether's existence is largely considered mythical.
      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    - target: {fileID: 6265842098296442303, guid: 301fcd3cc8495114b94af302ccd90021,
        type: 3}
      propertyPath: dialogue.sentences.Array.data[12]
      value: Being creatures of free will, our destinies are for us to choose, not
        our inherent elements.
